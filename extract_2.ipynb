New polling that will not be welcome news for Hillary Clinton, it is 6:00 P.M., the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Southern California, site of next week's CNN Republican Presidential Debate.  Now just six days away, the breaking news on that, we can now say that these are the 11 candidates who qualify for the main debate.  Rand Paul, Huckabee, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, John Kasick, and Chris Christie.\",\n",

Dr. Carson is the only other candidate in double digits, so he very busy hour ahead, a lot to talk about starting on the democratic side where those new CNN/ORC poll numbers have just come out and chief national correspondent John King has them.  So let's look at democratic candidates, where do they stand?\",\n",

       "  \"JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anderson, let me just bring up the numbers because the numbers don't lie and this is bad news, the bad night for the Clinton campaign.  Nationally right now, she still leads at 37 percent, you see Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 27 percent.  The vice president at 20 percent, Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor at 3.  But remember this 37 percent now is where Hillary Clinton is, let's fill in the blanks.\",\n",

       "  \"Now we talked the last hour about how Donald Trump is a growth stock. Look at this, Hillary Clinton was at 58 percent just a couple months ago, she's lost nearly 20 points.  Bernie Sanders a steady climb, he's plateaud at about 27 there.  The vice president up a little bit right there.  So if you're in the Clinton campaign, these national numbers that's a sign of trouble.  That's a warning sign.  Sanders again is on the rise at the moment and Joe Biden, not so bad.\",\n",

The gender gap is playing to her advantage for support, 41 percent of democratic women support Secretary Clinton, very interesting divided in the democratic race right now.  Among those who describe themselves as liberals, only 23 percent support Hillary Clinton.  She gets nearly half of democrats who say \"I\\'m a moderate.\"  Now watch the flipside here, if you look at Bernie Sanders support, he gets nearly half of those who say they\\'re liberals and only 15 percent of those who say they are moderates.  So you have an interesting philosophical debate within the Democratic Party now, Anderson as this all plays out.',\n",

Number one, if you ask democrats who they think will win the nomination right now, 55 percent still say Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is up to 22 percent in that number.  But when you do general election match ups, Clinton or Biden versus Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton ties Donald Trump right now, Joe Biden would beat them by 10 points in our new poll.',\n",

       "  \"How about versus Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton would lose by two points, that's a statistical tie, but she's losing by two points.  Joe Biden can say, hey I'm beating Jeb by eight points right now in the national polls, and versus Ben Carson, who is the leading republican now when it comes to general election match ups, Hillary Clinton will lose to Ben Carson by five points at the moment, Joe Biden by only three so that was about a statistical tie.  But if you look at the frontrunner at the moment, Joe Biden can say, I beat him and the person, republicans think will win, if it's not Donald Trump, Joe Biden can say, I beat him too.

She was at 52 percent in the last Quinnipiac poll.  So Hillary Clinton is going down, Bernie Sanders coming up in the first caucus state.  Remember Iowa is where it all fell apart for Hillary Clinton in 2008.  Why?  Liberal caucus goers in Iowa, 59 percent of Iowa democrats describe -- those who those describe themselves as very liberal, 59 percent for Bernie Sanders, only 29 percent for Hillary Clinton, so liberals who tend to show up at the causes are for Bernie Sanders, that's the source of his momentum and Anderson, one more quick number from this Iowa poll, are your candidates honest and trust worthy?

      "[21:00:35] ANDERSON COOPER, AC360 HOST:  Hey good evening.  Thanks for joining us 9:00 P.M., in New York, where we have breaking news.  New polling that will not be welcome news for Hillary Clinton, it is 6:00 P.M., the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Southern California, site of next week's CNN Republican Presidential Debate.  Now just six days away, the breaking news on that, we can now say that these are the 11 candidates who qualify for the main debate.  Rand Paul, Huckabee, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, John Kasick, and Chris Christie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five others will be debating earlier and here are the republican leaders in our new CNN/ORC polling with Donald Trump now topping 30 percent for the very first time.  Dr. Carson is the only other candidate in double digits, so he very busy hour ahead, a lot to talk about starting on the democratic side where those new CNN/ORC poll numbers have just come out and chief national correspondent John King has them.  So let's look at democratic candidates, where do they stand?\n",
      "\n",
      "JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anderson, let me just bring up the numbers because the numbers don't lie and this is bad news, the bad night for the Clinton campaign.  Nationally right now, she still leads at 37 percent, you see Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 27 percent.  The vice president at 20 percent, Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor at 3.  But remember this 37 percent now is where Hillary Clinton is, let's fill in the blanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we talked the last hour about how Donald Trump is a growth stock. Look at this, Hillary Clinton was at 58 percent just a couple months ago, she's lost nearly 20 points.  Bernie Sanders a steady climb, he's plateaud at about 27 there.  The vice president up a little bit right there.  So if you're in the Clinton campaign, these national numbers that's a sign of trouble.  That's a warning sign.  Sanders again is on the rise at the moment and Joe Biden, not so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at Hillary Clinton support, here's a problem for her, only 31 percent of democratic men support Hillary Clinton.  The gender gap is playing to her advantage for support, 41 percent of democratic women support Secretary Clinton, very interesting divided in the democratic race right now.  Among those who describe themselves as liberals, only 23 percent support Hillary Clinton.  She gets nearly half of democrats who say \"I'm a moderate.\"  Now watch the flipside here, if you look at Bernie Sanders support, he gets nearly half of those who say they're liberals and only 15 percent of those who say they are moderates.  So you have an interesting philosophical debate within the Democratic Party now, Anderson as this all plays out.\n",
      "\n",
      "COOPER:  The poll, I understand also took a look at how the various democratic candidates would fare against republican rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "KING:  Now the interesting numbers here are for Joe Biden as he considers his choice about whether or not to get into the race. Number one, if you ask democrats who they think will win the nomination right now, 55 percent still say Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is up to 22 percent in that number.  But when you do general election match ups, Clinton or Biden versus Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton ties Donald Trump right now, Joe Biden would beat them by 10 points in our new poll.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about versus Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton would lose by two points, that's a statistical tie, but she's losing by two points.  Joe Biden can say, hey I'm beating Jeb by eight points right now in the national polls, and versus Ben Carson, who is the leading republican now when it comes to general election match ups, Hillary Clinton will lose to Ben Carson by five points at the moment, Joe Biden by only three so that was about a statistical tie.  But if you look at the frontrunner at the moment, Joe Biden can say, I beat him and the person, republicans think will win, if it's not Donald Trump, Joe Biden can say, I beat him too.  So this first challenge Anderson, will be the win the nomination but if you're Biden and you're making an assessment, that makes you smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "COOPER:  And Bernie Sanders, I want to ask you about because he's actually now surged ahead of Hillary Clinton in Iowa for the first time, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "KING:  Right, and that's -- let's look at those numbers, we'll look at a different model.  We don't have those in the wall right here.  But Bernie Sanders right now is at 41 percent in Iowa according to the new Quinnipiac University poll, up from 33 percent just last month.  I remember Hillary Clinton is now at 40 percent.  She was at 52 percent in the last Quinnipiac poll.  So Hillary Clinton is going down, Bernie Sanders coming up in the first caucus state.  Remember Iowa is where it all fell apart for Hillary Clinton in 2008.  Why?  Liberal caucus goers in Iowa, 59 percent of Iowa democrats describe -- those who those describe themselves as very liberal, 59 percent for Bernie Sanders, only 29 percent for Hillary Clinton, so liberals who tend to show up at the causes are for Bernie Sanders, that's the source of his momentum and Anderson, one more quick number from this Iowa poll, are your candidates honest and trust worthy?  Sixty four percent say that about Hillary Clinton, 86 percent say that about Bernie Sanders, 91 percent about Joe Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the honest and trustworthy factor hurting Hillary Clinton in the first kickoff state of Iowa.\n",
      "\n",
      "COOPER:  And John, stay there because I want to bring in our two political analysts Gloria Borger, as well as Chief Clinton supporter and Super PAC consul (ph), Paul Begala is also a CNN political commentator, I'm not sure that is your official title.\n",

Remember the first democratic debate is October 13th, there's been a joke in the Biden inner circle, announce that morning that you're getting into the race and show up for the debate but that's it's a joke, they understand -- they understand to get -- if he is going to join the race, he has to signal if not by the last day of September, by the first or second of October that he is getting in and I'm told you he will make the decision in that timeframe and I agree  with everything Gloria said about, when you listen to him publicly, he seems to be pulling back a bit from where he was a week...\n",

Does that go to Hillary Clinton?\n",
      "\n",
      "BEGALA:  Well, actually right now, I think the vice president in the polling data, John could correct me if I'm wrong, seems to be takes a bit from both, Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton.  I think Gloria is spot on.  This is a man who has just been through hell and has been crushed and his heart has been broken and he's a friend of mine, I love the guy, he's beloved across the Democratic Party.\n",

I think he is being completely honest that there's probably some moments where he feels like I've really got this in me and then there's other moments where he feels like he doesn't...\n",

      "\n",
      "BEGALA:  Well, it's a couple of things.  Seems to me they have three options.  I've been through a lot of campaigns, they've all had problems.  Option one is panic, freak out and fire everybody, not a good idea, almost never works.\n",

So option three is, you know, whether the storm with some humility and humanity with some grace and try to push it back to the ideas.  Well, while we've all been covering the e-mail stuff, and Mr. Trump, she has put out really good policy papers on cleaning up the dirty money in politics, on battling addiction, on making college more affordable. She needs to get our attention back to that.  She could do it.  She -- that's her challenge as a candidate is not only our fault.\n",

I think that first democratic debate is critical for Secretary Clinton to remind democratic voters, I'm the candidate.  She need to make this case, I'm the candidate you want to send into the general election, because we want to keep the White House and history says we won't and I'm a stronger general election candidate, whether she's just up there against Sanders, O'Malley, and Senator Webb and the likes and (inaudible) or whether Joe Biden is on the stage.

It's one of the worst deals I've ever seen.  It's the most one-sided, lopsided, disgrace and how it goes through is unbelievable and we should not give them money.
